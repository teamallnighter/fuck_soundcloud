# Sound Cloud

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/55a85817-8258-4c22-aa1b-f411052f1c11/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/fuck-soundcloud-player/deploys)

Sound Cloud keeps blocking my remixes so I built this app to share music. 

[live demo](https://fuck-soundcloud-player.netlify.app/)


Clone the repo and just use live server. Super easy.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teamallnighter/fuck_soundcloud.git a-project-name
```

if you are using netlify

```bash
netlify init
netlify dev
```

Everything is in script.js
